# Hackadon PyJam Road-sign detection
In the single object detection, the `training.py` is for training the model, the `traffic_classifier.keras` is the trained model and the `gui.py` is for testing the model.
                                
In the multi object detection, it is still work in progress.
We have 2 possible solutions: Fix the current code problems or use a pre-trained model (ex. from hugging-face) and fine-tune it with german road signs
